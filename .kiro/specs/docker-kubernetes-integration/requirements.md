# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the GoalTrajectory.AI platform with industry-standard containerization and orchestration capabilities. The current project has basic Docker Compose setup but lacks production-ready containerization for all services and Kubernetes deployment configurations. This enhancement will provide a complete containerization strategy that mirrors production environments in the tech industry, including proper Dockerfiles, multi-stage builds, Kubernetes manifests, and production-ready configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Dockerfiles for all services, so that I can build optimized container images for both development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the backend service THEN the system SHALL create a multi-stage Dockerfile that separates build and runtime dependencies
2. WHEN building the frontend service THEN the system SHALL create a Dockerfile that optimizes for static asset serving
3. WHEN building containers THEN the system SHALL use appropriate base images and minimize image size
4. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL exclude development dependencies and tools

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive Docker Compose configurations, so that I can run the entire application stack locally with production-like settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running docker-compose THEN the system SHALL start all required services including frontend, backend, and ChromaDB
2. WHEN using development mode THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading and volume mounts for code changes
3. WHEN using production mode THEN the system SHALL use optimized builds without development tools
4. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL implement proper health checks and dependency ordering

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want Kubernetes deployment manifests, so that I can deploy the application to production Kubernetes clusters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Kubernetes THEN the system SHALL provide deployment manifests for all services
2. WHEN configuring services THEN the system SHALL use ConfigMaps for configuration and Secrets for sensitive data
3. WHEN exposing services THEN the system SHALL provide Service and Ingress configurations
4. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support horizontal pod autoscaling based on resource usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want proper health checks and monitoring, so that I can ensure application reliability in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers start THEN the system SHALL implement readiness and liveness probes
2. WHEN services are unhealthy THEN the system SHALL automatically restart or replace containers
3. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL expose metrics endpoints for Prometheus integration
4. WHEN logging THEN the system SHALL use structured logging with proper log levels

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want secure container configurations, so that the application follows security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running containers THEN the system SHALL use non-root users for application processes
2. WHEN handling secrets THEN the system SHALL use Kubernetes Secrets instead of environment variables for sensitive data
3. WHEN configuring networks THEN the system SHALL implement proper network policies and service mesh integration
4. WHEN scanning images THEN the system SHALL use minimal base images and regularly updated dependencies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configurations, so that I can easily switch between development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific configuration files
2. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate resource limits and requests per environment
3. WHEN configuring databases THEN the system SHALL support different database configurations per environment
4. WHEN handling external services THEN the system SHALL use environment-specific service endpoints and credentials
